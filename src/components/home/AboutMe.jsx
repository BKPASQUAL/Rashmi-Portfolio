          Hi, I’m Rashmi! As a full-stack developer with a foundation in
          Computer System Engineering, I specialize in crafting innovative web
          and mobile applications that combine functionality with exceptional
          user experiences. My core expertise lies in PHP, Python, and Flutter,
          but my diverse skill set spans languages like JavaScript, Java, C,
          Kotlin, Dart, VB.NET, MAUI, CSS, and MATLAB, empowering me to adapt to
          various challenges in software development. I’m fascinated by the
          intersection of technology and creativity, especially in emerging
          fields like machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics, and
          system integration. These interests drive me to stay ahead of the
          curve by learning new tools and methodologies to deliver solutions
          that truly make a difference. Beyond development, I’m passionate about
          fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing within the tech
          community. I believe in using technology as a force for connection,
          problem-solving, and innovation. Outside of work, you’ll find me
          enjoying a Netflix binge or diving into a thought-provoking
          movie activities that recharge my mind and spark new ideas. For me,
          coding is more than just a career it’s a way to transform ideas into
          impactful realities.
